- **Module CLAUDE.md:** 150 line MAXIMUM (target 80-100)
- Size enforced on every update
- Pruning required when >80% capacity

**The "6-Month Test":**
Before adding anything, ask: "Will this matter to me 6 months from now?"

**What TO include:**
- ‚úÖ Non-obvious gotchas and surprises
- ‚úÖ Security/performance implications
- ‚úÖ Architectural decisions with "why"
- ‚úÖ Common mistakes to avoid
- ‚úÖ Framework/library quirks worth remembering

**What NOT to include:**
- ‚ùå File paths/directory structure (visible via ls/grep)
- ‚ùå Standard framework usage patterns
- ‚ùå Implementation details visible in code
- ‚ùå API documentation (belongs in code comments)
- ‚ùå Setup steps in package.json/README
- ‚ùå Obvious naming conventions
- ‚ùå Generic best practices from docs
- ‚ùå Tool installation instructions
- ‚ùå Comprehensive feature lists

**Writing style:**
- Use bullets, NOT paragraphs
- 1 line per point when possible
- Examples ONLY when they clarify gotchas
- No fluff, preamble, or generic explanations

## Root CLAUDE.md

**Purpose:** Project-wide context that Claude Code automatically loads

**Location:** `{project-root}/CLAUDE.md`

**Structure:**
```markdown
# Project: {Project Name}

## Tech Stack
- Runtime/Language versions
- Major frameworks and libraries
- Database and infrastructure

## Architecture
- High-level architecture pattern (MVC, microservices, etc.)
- Key architectural decisions and rationale

## Project Structure
- Directory organization
- Module responsibilities
- Important file locations

## Development
- Setup instructions
- Common commands
- Environment variables

## Conventions
- Naming conventions
- Code style guidelines
- Testing approach

## Recent Changes (Last 3-6 months)
- Significant architectural changes
- New patterns adopted
- Deprecations
```

**Management:**
- Created manually or by Keep skill
- Updated by Keep skill suggestions (with user approval)
- **MAXIMUM 200 lines** (enforced - target 120-150)
- Size validated on every update
- Pruning required when >80% capacity

**Example (CONCISE - 45 lines):**
```markdown
# Project: TaskMaster API

## Tech Stack
- Node 18, TypeScript 5, Express 4
- PostgreSQL 14 + TypeORM, Redis
- Jest for testing

## Architecture
RESTful API with repository pattern (controllers ‚Üí services ‚Üí repositories)

Key decisions:
- TypeORM for type safety and migrations
- Redis for caching + rate limiting
- JWT access (15min) + refresh tokens (7d rotation)

## Development
```bash
npm run dev    # Port 3000
npm test       # Run tests
```

## Conventions
- camelCase functions, PascalCase classes
- Tests co-located: *.test.ts
- Conventional commits (feat:, fix:)

## Gotchas
- Health checks (/health, /metrics) bypass rate limiting - don't apply middleware globally
- Refresh tokens use one-time rotation - invalidate immediately after use
- bcrypt at 12 rounds - don't increase (perf impact)

## Recent Changes
- 2024-10: Added rate limiting (express-rate-limit + Redis)
- 2024-09: Migrated Sequelize ‚Üí TypeORM
```

**Anti-pattern Example (TOO VERBOSE - 110 lines):**
```markdown
# Project: TaskMaster API

## Overview
TaskMaster API is a comprehensive task management system built with modern
TypeScript and Node.js. It provides a RESTful interface for managing tasks,
users, and teams with enterprise-grade authentication and authorization.

## Tech Stack

[... 80 more lines of obvious details ...]
```

**Why the concise version is better:**
- ‚úÖ 45 lines vs 110 lines (59% smaller)
- ‚úÖ Focuses on non-obvious gotchas
- ‚úÖ Skips details visible in package.json
- ‚úÖ Emphasizes "why" decisions were made
- ‚úÖ No fluff or generic explanations

## Nested CLAUDE.md Files

**Purpose:** Domain-specific context for modules/directories

**Location:** `{project-root}/{directory}/CLAUDE.md`

**Structure:**
```markdown
# {Module Name}

## Purpose
What this module does and why it exists

## Key Patterns
- Specific patterns used in this module
- Important abstractions
- Design decisions

## API / Public Interface
- Key functions/classes
- How other modules interact with this

```

**Management:**
- Created by Keep skill when working in new area (with user approval)
- Updated as patterns emerge and learnings accumulate
- **MAXIMUM 150 lines** (enforced - target 80-100)
- Keep skill suggests updates, user reviews and approves
- Size validated on every update
- Pruning required when >80% capacity

**When to Create:**
- Working in a directory for 2nd+ time
- Non-obvious patterns worth documenting
- Complex gotchas that benefit from explanation
- **Don't create prematurely** - let need emerge
- Must pass "6-month test": will this matter later?

**When NOT to Create:**
- File structure is obvious
- Standard framework patterns only
- No surprising gotchas
- Code is self-explanatory

**Example (CONCISE - 35 lines):**
```markdown
# Authentication Module

## Purpose
User auth with JWT + refresh token rotation, rate limiting for brute force protection.

## Key Patterns
- JWT access (15min) + refresh (7d, one-time rotation in Redis)
- bcrypt 12 rounds - don't increase (perf impact)
- Per-IP rate limiting: 5/15min (login), 3/15min (reset)

## Gotchas
- **Health checks bypass rate limiting** - exclude /health, /metrics or monitoring breaks
- **Refresh tokens are one-time use** - invalidate immediately after rotation
- **Rate limit headers auto-added** - don't manually set X-RateLimit-*
- **Redis failures degrade gracefully** - falls back to in-memory (per-instance)
- **Never log tokens** - use token.substring(0,10) for debugging

## Common Mistakes
- ‚ùå Forgetting to hash passwords in test fixtures
- ‚ùå Applying rate limiting globally (breaks health checks)
- ‚ùå Not invalidating old refresh token on rotation

## Testing
- Mock Redis in unit tests (redis-mock)
- Real Redis for integration tests
```

**Anti-pattern Example (TOO VERBOSE - 95 lines):**
```markdown

**Why the concise version is better:**
- ‚úÖ 35 lines vs 95 lines (63% smaller)
- ‚úÖ Focuses on gotchas and surprises
- ‚úÖ No API documentation (use code comments)
- ‚úÖ Emphasizes common mistakes
- ‚úÖ Skips obvious implementation details

# Issue #1234: Add rate limiting to authentication

**GitHub:** https://github.com/myuser/taskmaster-api/issues/1234
**Pull Request:** https://github.com/myuser/taskmaster-api/pull/456
**Status:** completed
**Started:** 2024-10-23T10:00:00Z
**Completed:** 2024-10-23T16:00:00Z

## Issue Description
Add rate limiting to authentication endpoints to prevent brute force attacks.

## Approach
1. Use express-rate-limit middleware (widely used, good TypeScript support)
2. Redis store for distributed rate limiting (already in stack)
3. Apply to /login, /register, /reset-password
4. Conservative limits initially (5 per 15min)
5. Exclude health check endpoints

## Progress Log

### 2024-10-23T16:00:00Z
- ‚úÖ All tests passing (unit + integration)
- ‚úÖ Updated API documentation
- ‚úÖ Deployed to staging
- Ready for review

### 2024-10-23T14:30:00Z
- Implemented rate limiter middleware in src/auth/middleware/rateLimiter.ts
- Configured limits: 5 requests per 15 minutes for /login
- Configured limits: 3 requests per 15 minutes for /reset-password
- Applied middleware to auth routes

### 2024-10-23T12:00:00Z
- Researched options: express-rate-limit vs rate-limiter-flexible
- Decided on express-rate-limit (simpler, sufficient for needs)
- Installed dependencies: express-rate-limit, rate-limit-redis

### 2024-10-23T10:00:00Z
- Started work on issue
- Read issue description and requirements
- Reviewed existing auth implementation

## Decisions Made

1. **Rate limit strategy:** Per-IP for unauthenticated routes
   - Rationale: Simplest approach, prevents IP-based brute force
   - Alternative considered: Per-user for authenticated (complexity not needed yet)
   - Impact: Future enhancement could add per-user for authenticated routes

2. **Storage backend:** Redis (not in-memory)
   - Rationale: Already using Redis, need distributed limiting
   - Alternative considered: In-memory (rejected - won't work with multiple instances)
   - Impact: Requires Redis connection, but we already have it

3. **Limit values:** 5 per 15min (login), 3 per 15min (reset)
   - Rationale: Conservative start, can adjust based on monitoring
   - Alternative considered: 10 per 15min (rejected - too permissive)
   - Impact: May need tuning after observing real usage

4. **Health check exclusion:** Exclude /health and /metrics
   - Rationale: Monitoring shouldn't be rate limited
   - Alternative considered: Apply to all routes (rejected - breaks monitoring)
   - Impact: Need separate middleware chain for health endpoints

## Files Modified

- src/auth/middleware/rateLimiter.ts (created)
  - Main rate limiter middleware
  - Redis store configuration
  - Error handling for Redis failures

- src/auth/routes.ts (modified)
  - Applied rate limiting to auth routes
  - Excluded health checks from rate limiting

- src/auth/middleware/index.ts (modified)
  - Export rate limiter middleware

- package.json (modified)
  - Added: express-rate-limit ^7.0.0
  - Added: rate-limit-redis ^4.0.0

- tests/unit/auth/rateLimiter.test.ts (created)
  - Tests for rate limiter middleware
  - Mock Redis for unit tests

- tests/integration/auth/rateLimiting.test.ts (created)
  - End-to-end rate limiting tests
  - Verify limits enforced correctly

- docs/api/authentication.md (modified)
  - Documented rate limits
  - Added X-RateLimit-* headers documentation

## Learnings

1. **express-rate-limit TypeScript support**
   - Excellent type definitions out of the box
   - Easy to configure with our Redis setup

2. **Health check exclusion pattern**
   - Need to apply rate limiting selectively
   - Use route-specific middleware, not global

3. **Rate limit headers**
   - X-RateLimit-Limit, X-RateLimit-Remaining automatically added
   - Helps clients implement retry logic

4. **Testing with Redis**
   - Use redis-mock for unit tests (fast, isolated)
   - Use real Redis for integration tests (accurate)

5. **Error handling**
   - If Redis fails, rate limiting degrades gracefully
   - Falls back to in-memory (per instance, but better than nothing)

## Tests

- [x] Unit tests for rateLimiter middleware (8/8 passing)
- [x] Integration tests for login rate limiting (3/3 passing)
- [x] Test rate limit header presence (2/2 passing)
- [x] Manual testing on staging environment

## Next Actions

None - work complete

## Related Issues

- #1100 - JWT implementation (prerequisite)
- #1250 - Add monitoring for rate limit hits (follow-up, created)

### Status Indicators
- ‚úÖ Completed
- üîÑ In progress
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Pending/not started
- ‚ùå Blocked or failed

### File Paths
- Always use relative paths from project root
- Use forward slashes: `src/auth/middleware/rateLimiter.ts`
- Note create vs modify: `(created)` or `(modified)`

### Markdown Structure
- Use `##` for major sections
- Use `###` for timestamps in progress log
- Use `**bold**` for field names: `**Status:** in_progress`
- Use lists for progress items, decisions, learnings

---

## Validation

When creating or updating files, ensure:

1. **All required sections present**
2. **Timestamps in ISO 8601 format**
3. **Issue numbers prefixed with #**
