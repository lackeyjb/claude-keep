# Keep Grow - Grow Project Context

Analyze a directory to identify patterns and create/update CLAUDE.md files that provide valuable context for future work.

## Core Workflow

### 1. Parse Arguments and Determine Target Directory

**Parse flags from arguments:**
- `--update`: Update existing CLAUDE.md (skip "create new" flow)
- `--condense`: Prune bloated CLAUDE.md to fit within size limits
- `--force`: Create even if patterns unclear

**Determine directory:**
- First non-flag argument = target directory
- If no directory argument: use current working directory or project root

**Validate directory:**
```bash
ls {directory}
```

If directory doesn't exist, inform user and exit gracefully.

**Special mode: --condense**

If `--condense` flag present:
1. Read existing CLAUDE.md
2. Count current lines
3. If within limits (â‰¤200 root, â‰¤150 module): inform user, exit
4. If over limit: Analyze content and identify low-value items to prune
5. Generate pruned version that fits within limits
6. Show diff with line reduction
7. Get approval and update

Skip normal analysis flow when `--condense` is used.

### 2. Analyze Directory

**Scan file structure:**
Use Glob to find all files:
```
Pattern: {directory}/**/*
```

Identify:
- File types (languages, frameworks)
- Directory organization
- Entry points and main modules
- Configuration files

**Read key files:**
- Entry point files (index.*, main.*, __init__.*)
- Exported interfaces/types
- README or docs if present
- Main modules (largest or most central files)

**Identify patterns:**
- Frameworks in use (React, Express, Django, etc.)
- Design patterns (repository, factory, etc.)
- Naming conventions
- Module responsibilities
- Abstraction layers

**Detect dependencies:**
- External libraries used
- Internal module dependencies
- Shared utilities or patterns

### 3. Assess Value of Documentation

Ask these questions:

**Is this a cohesive module?**
- Does directory have clear boundaries?
- Does it serve a specific purpose?
- Or is it just a grab bag of utilities?

**Are patterns clear enough?**
- Can you identify consistent approaches?
- Are there established conventions?
- Or is code too heterogeneous?

**Would future work benefit?**
- Will you work here again?
- Is logic complex enough to need explanation?
- Are there gotchas worth documenting?

**Is it too early?**
- Has module been worked on enough?
- Have patterns emerged, or is it still forming?
- Risk of premature documentation?

**Quality bar - "6-Month Test":**

See `agents/shared/quality-filters.md` for detailed assessment of whether documentation is valuable and passes quality bar.

**Decision:**
- If valuable AND passes quality bar â†’ Proceed to proposal
- If too early â†’ Suggest waiting
- If not cohesive â†’ Suggest different scope
- If patterns are obvious â†’ Skip documentation

### 4. Check for Existing CLAUDE.md

Read existing file if present:
```bash
cat {directory}/CLAUDE.md
```

**If exists and no --update flag:**
- Show current content
- Ask: "Update existing CLAUDE.md? [yes/no]"
- If no: Exit gracefully

**If --update flag:**
- Load existing content
- Plan updates/additions

### 5. Generate Proposal

See `agents/shared/size-validation.md` for complete size budget and validation process.

**Quick reference:**
- **Root CLAUDE.md:** 200 line MAXIMUM (target 120-150 lines)
- **Module CLAUDE.md:** 150 line MAXIMUM (target 80-100 lines)
- If updating and >80% capacity: identify content to prune first
- Target net-zero or negative line growth

Draft CLAUDE.md following format from `skills/keep/references/file-formats.md` (load for format details):

**For root CLAUDE.md (project root):**
```markdown
# Project: {Name}

## Tech Stack
- Runtime/language versions (concise: "Node 18, TypeScript 5")
- Major frameworks only (not utilities)
- Database and infrastructure

## Architecture
- High-level pattern (1 sentence)
- Key architectural decisions (2-3 bullets max)

## Project Structure
- Directory organization (just main dirs)
- Module responsibilities (1 line each)

## Development
- Setup: 2-3 commands only
- Key environment variables only

## Conventions
- Critical conventions only
- Gotchas and non-obvious rules

## Recent Changes (Last 3-6 months)
- Only significant architectural changes
- Max 3-4 items
```

**For module CLAUDE.md:**
```markdown
# {Module Name}

## Purpose
1-2 sentences on what and why

## Key Patterns
- Non-obvious patterns only
- Critical design decisions
- 3-5 bullets max

## Recent Learnings
- Gotchas that aren't obvious from code
- Performance/security considerations
- Common mistakes to avoid
- 3-5 bullets max

## Dependencies (optional - only if non-obvious)
- External dependencies worth noting
- Internal coupling points
```

**Ruthless Conciseness Guidelines:**

See `agents/shared/quality-filters.md` for detailed guidance on what to include vs exclude, plus examples of good vs bad content.

**Key principles:**
- Focus on non-obvious gotchas, not obvious patterns
- Explain decisions and surprises, not structure
- Use bullets, not paragraphs
- 1 line per point when possible
- Examples only when they clarify gotchas

### 6. Present Proposal

See `agents/shared/size-validation.md` for complete presentation format and size warning guidelines.

**Quick steps:**
1. Count lines in proposal
2. If updating: verify current + net change â‰¤ limits
3. Show complete content with size information
4. Present high-value insights captured
5. Get user approval (yes / edit / later / no)

### 7. Handle User Response

**If yes:**
- Create or update file
- Confirm creation/update
- Note that Claude Code will auto-load this for future work in this directory

**If edit:**
- Enter conversational editing mode
- Make adjustments based on feedback
- Show revised version
- Repeat approval process

**If later:**
- Note suggestion in current work file (if working on issue)
- Exit gracefully
- User can run `/keep:grow` again later

**If no:**
- Exit gracefully
- No hard feelings - premature documentation is worse than none

### 8. Create/Update File

**Final validation:**
1. Count lines in final approved content
2. Verify â‰¤200 (root) or â‰¤150 (module)
3. If over: ask user to trim further
4. Only write if within limits

**If creating:**
- Use Write tool to create {directory}/CLAUDE.md

**If updating:**
- Use Edit tool on existing file to apply changes

**Confirm with size:**
- Show final size: {final_lines} / {max} lines ({percentage}%)
- Note that Claude Code will auto-load this file in future sessions
- If >80% capacity: suggest pruning before next update

## Special Cases

### Root CLAUDE.md Creation

When analyzing project root (`.` or project top-level):

**Additional analysis:**
- Read package.json / pyproject.toml / go.mod / Cargo.toml
- Check for .github/ directory
- Identify CI/CD setup
- Note deployment approach

**Focus on:**
- Overall tech stack
- Project-wide conventions
- High-level architecture
- Setup and development workflow

### Updating Existing CLAUDE.md

When `--update` flag present or updating existing:

**Size-aware process:**
1. Read existing content and count lines
2. Identify what's outdated, stale, or low-value
3. If >80% capacity: MUST remove content before adding
4. Propose specific additions/changes as diff
5. Show net line change
6. Target net-zero or negative growth

**Be surgical:**
- Don't rewrite unnecessarily
- Add new high-value insights
- Remove stale/obvious information
- Update outdated sections
- Prioritize pruning over adding

**Content to prune (examples):**
- Outdated architectural decisions
- Obvious patterns now visible in code
- Temporary workarounds that are gone
- Generic advice available in docs
- Implementation details

### No Clear Patterns Found

If analysis reveals insufficient patterns:

```markdown
ðŸ“‹ Analysis of {directory}

I analyzed {directory} but found:
â€¢ Only {N} files
â€¢ No clear patterns emerged yet
â€¢ Code appears to be early stage / in flux

ðŸ’­ Recommendation: Wait until module is more developed

CLAUDE.md is most valuable when:
- Module has been worked on multiple times
- Clear patterns have emerged
- There are gotchas worth documenting

Come back to this after:
- Working here a few more times
- Patterns become clearer
- Code stabilizes

Or use --force flag if you want to document anyway.
```

## Error Handling

See `agents/shared/error-handling.md` for general error patterns.

**Grow-specific errors:**
- **Directory doesn't exist:** Inform user, suggest checking path, exit gracefully
- **Permission denied:** Note permission issue, suggest checking file permissions, exit gracefully
- **Existing CLAUDE.md conflicts:** Show current content, ask if user wants to update, never silently overwrite
- **Empty or minimal directory:** Note insufficient content, suggest waiting for more code, exit unless --force used

## Best Practices & Philosophy

See `agents/shared/principles.md` for core principles on premature documentation, ruthless conciseness, and focus on "why not what".

See `agents/shared/quality-filters.md` for detailed guidance on what's worth documenting.

Key reminders:
- Enforce size limits strictly: Root 200 max, Module 150 max
- Warn at 80% capacity, require pruning before adding
- Make it actionable: specific gotchas over general advice
- Think of CLAUDE.md as "What do I wish I knew before working here?"

## Workflow Hint

After successfully creating or updating a CLAUDE.md file, provide this next step hint:

```
ðŸ’¡ **Next steps:** This CLAUDE.md will auto-load in future sessions. Continue your work, or use `/keep:save` to capture any learnings related to this documentation.
```
