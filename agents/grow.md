# Keep Grow - Grow Project Context

Analyze a directory to identify patterns and provide structured analysis data for CLAUDE.md creation.

**Note:** The parent command handles gatekeeper coordination (assess documentation value, generate proposals, present for approval, write files). This sub-agent focuses on directory analysis and pattern detection.

## Input from Parent Command

The parent command provides:
- **target_directory** - Directory to analyze
- **flags** - Object with: update, condense, force

## Core Workflow

### 1. Parse Arguments and Validate Directory

**Parse flags from arguments:**
- `--update`: Update existing CLAUDE.md (skip "create new" flow)
- `--condense`: Prune bloated CLAUDE.md to fit within size limits
- `--force`: Create even if patterns unclear

**Determine directory:**
- First non-flag argument = target directory
- If no directory argument: use current working directory or project root

**Validate directory:**
```bash
ls {directory}
```

If directory doesn't exist, inform user and exit gracefully.

**Special mode: --condense**

If `--condense` flag present:
1. Read existing CLAUDE.md
2. Count current lines
3. If within limits (≤200 root, ≤150 module): inform user, exit
4. If over limit: Analyze content and identify low-value items to prune
5. Generate pruned version that fits within limits
6. Show diff with line reduction
7. Get approval and update

Skip normal analysis flow when `--condense` is used.

### 2. Analyze Directory

**Scan file structure:**
Use Glob to find all files:
```
Pattern: {directory}/**/*
```

Identify:
- File types (languages, frameworks)
- Directory organization
- Entry points and main modules
- Configuration files

**Read key files:**
- Entry point files (index.*, main.*, __init__.*)
- Exported interfaces/types
- README or docs if present
- Main modules (largest or most central files)

**Identify patterns:**
- Frameworks in use (React, Express, Django, etc.)
- Design patterns (repository, factory, etc.)
- Naming conventions
- Module responsibilities
- Abstraction layers

**Detect dependencies:**
- External libraries used
- Internal module dependencies
- Shared utilities or patterns

### 3. Check for Existing CLAUDE.md

Read existing file if present:
```bash
cat {directory}/CLAUDE.md
```

**If exists and no --update flag:**
- Show current content
- Ask: "Update existing CLAUDE.md? [yes/no]"
- If no: Exit gracefully

**If --update flag:**
- Load existing content
- Include in return data for parent

### 4. Return Analysis Data to Parent Command

**Return to parent command:**
- directory_analysis (object with):
  - file_types (languages, frameworks detected)
  - directory_organization (structure)
  - entry_points (main files)
  - patterns (design patterns, conventions, naming)
  - dependencies (external libs, internal modules)
- patterns_found (boolean)
- existing_content (if --update or CLAUDE.md exists)
- is_root_directory (boolean)
- proposed_content_draft (suggested content based on analysis)
- affected_directories (list of key directories)

## Special Cases

### Root CLAUDE.md Analysis

When analyzing project root (`.` or project top-level):

**Additional analysis to include:**
- Read package.json / pyproject.toml / go.mod / Cargo.toml
- Check for .github/ directory
- Identify CI/CD setup
- Note deployment approach

**Focus patterns on:**
- Overall tech stack
- Project-wide conventions
- High-level architecture
- Setup and development workflow

### Updating Existing CLAUDE.md

When `--update` flag present:

**Analysis process:**
1. Read existing content and count lines
2. Identify what's outdated, stale, or low-value
3. Note current size and capacity
4. Propose new insights to add
5. Suggest content to prune (if over 80% capacity)

**Include in return data:**
- Current line count
- Outdated content to remove
- New insights to add
- Net line change estimate

### --condense Mode

When `--condense` flag present:

**Special workflow:**
1. Read existing CLAUDE.md
2. Count current lines
3. If within limits (≤200 root, ≤150 module): inform user, exit
4. If over limit: Identify low-value content to prune
5. Generate pruned version that fits within limits
6. Return pruned content with diff

**Skip normal analysis** - focus only on pruning existing content.

### Insufficient Patterns

If analysis reveals too few patterns:

**Set patterns_found = false and note:**
- File count is low (< 5 files)
- No clear patterns emerged
- Code appears early stage or in flux

**Parent will handle messaging** about waiting for more development.

## Error Handling

See `agents/shared/error-handling.md` for general error patterns.

**Key error scenarios:**
- **Directory doesn't exist:** Return error to parent command
- **Permission denied:** Return error with details
- **Empty or minimal directory:** Set patterns_found=false, note in analysis
- **Unable to read key files:** Note in analysis, continue with available data

## Best Practices & Philosophy

See `agents/shared/principles.md` for core principles on pattern detection and analysis.

See `agents/shared/quality-filters.md` for guidance on what patterns are worth documenting.

Key reminders for analysis:
- Focus on non-obvious patterns, not obvious structure
- Identify gotchas and surprises
- Note design decisions and their rationale
- Detect conventions that aren't immediately clear from code
- Think: "What do I wish I knew before working here?"
