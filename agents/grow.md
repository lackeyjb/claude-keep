# Keep Grow - Grow Project Context

Analyze a directory to identify patterns and create/update CLAUDE.md files that provide valuable context for future work.

## Core Workflow

### 1. Determine Target Directory

**If directory argument provided:**
- Use specified directory path
- Validate it exists

**If no argument:**
- Default to current working directory
- Or project root if at repository top level

**Validate directory:**
```bash
ls {directory}
```

If directory doesn't exist, inform user and exit gracefully.

### 2. Analyze Directory

**Scan file structure:**
Use Glob to find all files:
```
Pattern: {directory}/**/*
```

Identify:
- File types (languages, frameworks)
- Directory organization
- Entry points and main modules
- Configuration files

**Read key files:**
- Entry point files (index.*, main.*, __init__.*)
- Exported interfaces/types
- README or docs if present
- Main modules (largest or most central files)

**Identify patterns:**
- Frameworks in use (React, Express, Django, etc.)
- Design patterns (repository, factory, etc.)
- Naming conventions
- Module responsibilities
- Abstraction layers

**Detect dependencies:**
- External libraries used
- Internal module dependencies
- Shared utilities or patterns

### 3. Assess Value of Documentation

Ask these questions:

**Is this a cohesive module?**
- Does directory have clear boundaries?
- Does it serve a specific purpose?
- Or is it just a grab bag of utilities?

**Are patterns clear enough?**
- Can you identify consistent approaches?
- Are there established conventions?
- Or is code too heterogeneous?

**Would future work benefit?**
- Will you work here again?
- Is logic complex enough to need explanation?
- Are there gotchas worth documenting?

**Is it too early?**
- Has module been worked on enough?
- Have patterns emerged, or is it still forming?
- Risk of premature documentation?

**Decision:**
- If valuable → Proceed to proposal
- If too early → Suggest waiting
- If not cohesive → Suggest different scope

### 4. Check for Existing CLAUDE.md

Read existing file if present:
```bash
cat {directory}/CLAUDE.md
```

**If exists and no --update flag:**
- Show current content
- Ask: "Update existing CLAUDE.md? [yes/no]"
- If no: Exit gracefully

**If --update flag:**
- Load existing content
- Plan updates/additions

### 5. Generate Proposal

Draft CLAUDE.md following format from `skills/keep/references/file-formats.md` (load for format details):

**For root CLAUDE.md (project root):**
```markdown
# Project: {Name}

## Tech Stack
- Runtime/language versions
- Major frameworks and libraries
- Database and infrastructure

## Architecture
- High-level pattern (MVC, microservices, etc.)
- Key architectural decisions

## Project Structure
- Directory organization
- Module responsibilities

## Development
- Setup instructions
- Common commands
- Environment variables

## Conventions
- Naming conventions
- Code style
- Testing approach

## Recent Changes (Last 3-6 months)
- Significant architectural changes
- New patterns adopted
```

**For module CLAUDE.md:**
```markdown
# {Module Name}

## Purpose
What this module does and why

## Key Patterns
- Specific patterns used here
- Important abstractions
- Design decisions

## API / Public Interface
- Key functions/classes
- How other modules interact

## Recent Learnings
- Gotchas discovered
- Performance considerations
- Security considerations
- Common mistakes to avoid

## Dependencies
- External dependencies
- Internal dependencies

## Testing
- Testing approach
- Key test files
```

**Guidelines:**
- Keep concise (aim for <200 lines)
- Focus on "why" not "what"
- Document patterns, not implementation details
- Include examples if helpful
- Note gotchas and common mistakes

### 6. Present Proposal

**Show complete content:**
```markdown
📝 Proposed CLAUDE.md for {directory}

I've analyzed {directory} and found patterns worth documenting:
• {pattern 1}
• {pattern 2}
• {pattern 3}

{If updating existing:}
Proposed changes:
─────────────────────────────────
{show diff}
─────────────────────────────────

{If creating new:}
Proposed content:
─────────────────────────────────
{show full content}
─────────────────────────────────

This will help future work in {directory} by:
- {benefit 1}
- {benefit 2}
- {benefit 3}

{If creating:} Create {directory}/CLAUDE.md?
{If updating:} Update {directory}/CLAUDE.md?
[yes / edit / later / no]
```

### 7. Handle User Response

**If yes:**
- Create or update file
- Confirm creation/update
- Note that Claude Code will auto-load this for future work in this directory

**If edit:**
- Enter conversational editing mode
- Make adjustments based on feedback
- Show revised version
- Repeat approval process

**If later:**
- Note suggestion in current work file (if working on issue)
- Exit gracefully
- User can run `/keep:grow` again later

**If no:**
- Exit gracefully
- No hard feelings - premature documentation is worse than none

### 8. Create/Update File

**If creating:**
```bash
# Use Write tool
Write to: {directory}/CLAUDE.md
Content: {generated content}
```

**If updating:**
```bash
# Use Edit tool on existing file
Edit: {directory}/CLAUDE.md
Apply: {approved changes}
```

**Confirm:**
```markdown
✅ Created {directory}/CLAUDE.md

Claude Code will automatically load this file when working in {directory} in future sessions.

{If this was triggered by /keep:save suggestion:}
You can always update this later with `/keep:grow {directory} --update`
```

## Special Cases

### Root CLAUDE.md Creation

When analyzing project root (`.` or project top-level):

**Additional analysis:**
- Read package.json / pyproject.toml / go.mod / Cargo.toml
- Check for .github/ directory
- Identify CI/CD setup
- Note deployment approach

**Focus on:**
- Overall tech stack
- Project-wide conventions
- High-level architecture
- Setup and development workflow

### Updating Existing CLAUDE.md

When `--update` flag present or updating existing:

**Process:**
- Read existing content
- Identify what's outdated or missing
- Propose specific additions/changes
- Show as diff
- Preserve existing valuable content

**Be surgical:**
- Don't rewrite unnecessarily
- Add new sections if patterns emerged
- Update outdated information
- Remove stale information

### No Clear Patterns Found

If analysis reveals insufficient patterns:

```markdown
📋 Analysis of {directory}

I analyzed {directory} but found:
• Only {N} files
• No clear patterns emerged yet
• Code appears to be early stage / in flux

💭 Recommendation: Wait until module is more developed

CLAUDE.md is most valuable when:
- Module has been worked on multiple times
- Clear patterns have emerged
- There are gotchas worth documenting

Come back to this after:
- Working here a few more times
- Patterns become clearer
- Code stabilizes

Or use --force flag if you want to document anyway.
```

## Error Handling

**Directory doesn't exist:**
- Inform user
- Suggest checking path
- Exit gracefully

**Permission denied:**
- Note permission issue
- Suggest checking file permissions
- Exit gracefully

**Existing CLAUDE.md conflicts:**
- Show current content
- Ask if user wants to update or cancel
- Never silently overwrite

**Empty or minimal directory:**
- Note insufficient content
- Suggest waiting for more code
- Exit unless --force used

## Best Practices

**Don't create prematurely:**
- Wait for patterns to emerge
- Better to have no docs than wrong docs
- Let need become apparent

**Keep it concise:**
- <200 lines is ideal
- Focus on high-value information
- Avoid documenting obvious things

**Focus on why, not what:**
- Explain decisions, not just structure
- Document gotchas and insights
- Note common mistakes to avoid

**Make it actionable:**
- Include examples if helpful
- Note how to use patterns
- Provide testing guidance

## Philosophy

Growing project context should be:
- Deliberate, not automatic
- Valuable, not ceremonial
- Timely, not premature
- Evolving with the project

Think of CLAUDE.md as the README you wish you had when you started working in that area - written by you, for future you.

The best CLAUDE.md files answer: "What do I wish I knew before working here?"

## Workflow Hint

After successfully creating or updating a CLAUDE.md file, provide this next step hint:

```
💡 **Next steps:** This CLAUDE.md will auto-load in future sessions. Continue your work, or use `/keep:save` to capture any learnings related to this documentation.
```
