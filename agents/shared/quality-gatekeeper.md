# Quality Assessment Gatekeeper

Applies consistent quality filtering to all captured learnings and documentation across save and grow workflows.

## Operations

### Assess Learning

**Input:**
- Learning/decision text (the proposed content)
- Context (what it relates to, directory, domain)
- Type (learning, decision, pattern)

**Process:**

Apply the "6-Month Test": Would this matter 6 months from now?

Then assess against 5 quality criteria:

1. **Is it non-obvious?** Does it surprise developers unfamiliar with the code?
2. **Will it prevent mistakes?** Does it help avoid common pitfalls?
3. **Is it durable?** Will this still matter in 6 months?
4. **Is it specific?** Does it apply to this codebase, not everywhere?
5. **Is it actionable?** Can developers use this guidance?

**Scoring:**
- 5/5 criteria met: **High quality** (definitely capture)
- 3-4/5 criteria met: **Medium quality** (consider capturing)
- <3/5 criteria met: **Low quality** (skip)

**Return:**
```json
{
  "quality_score": 0-5,
  "six_month_test": "pass" | "fail",
  "criteria": {
    "non_obvious": true/false,
    "prevents_mistakes": true/false,
    "durable": true/false,
    "specific": true/false,
    "actionable": true/false
  },
  "recommendation": "capture" | "consider" | "skip",
  "reasoning": "Why this scored this way"
}
```

### Filter Learning Batch

**Input:**
- List of learnings/decisions proposed for capture
- Context (directory, domain)

**Process:**

1. Assess each learning individually
2. Apply filters consistently
3. Group results by recommendation
4. Provide summary statistics

**Return:**
```json
{
  "capture": [
    {"text": "...", "reasoning": "..."},
    {"text": "...", "reasoning": "..."}
  ],
  "consider": [
    {"text": "...", "reasoning": "..."}
  ],
  "skip": [
    {"text": "...", "reasoning": "..."}
  ],
  "summary": {
    "total": 10,
    "capture": 6,
    "consider": 2,
    "skip": 2
  }
}
```

### Assess Documentation Value

**Input:**
- Directory being analyzed (e.g., "src/auth", ".")
- Directory analysis/findings
- Current CLAUDE.md content (if exists)
- Proposed new/updated content

**Process:**

1. Check if patterns are clear enough to document
2. Check if directory is cohesive (fits together conceptually)
3. Apply 6-month test: Will developers need this 6 months from now?
4. Verify it passes quality bar (specific to codebase, actionable, non-obvious)
5. Assess whether update is needed or too early

**Return:**
```json
{
  "recommendation": "update" | "create" | "wait",
  "reasoning": "Why now or why wait",
  "quality_indicators": {
    "patterns_clear": true/false,
    "directory_cohesive": true/false,
    "six_month_test": "pass" | "fail",
    "quality_bar": "pass" | "fail"
  },
  "suggested_timing": "now" | "after_more_work" | "never"
}
```

### Check Learning Threshold

**Input:**
- Work file data (decisions and learnings from current session)
- Previous session data (from .claude/archive/ if available)

**Process:**

Detect if learning capture threshold is met:

1. Count decisions by directory
2. Count learnings by directory
3. Detect patterns (same directory 2+ sessions)
4. Look for recurring patterns (same issue/solution multiple times)
5. Check for security/performance insights (always capture)

**Thresholds:**
- **3+ decisions** in same directory → Capture-ready
- **2+ sessions** in same directory with decisions → Consider updating CLAUDE.md
- **Recurring patterns** across sessions → Document
- **Security/performance insights** → Always capture immediately
- **<3 decisions** in single session → Too early, save for later

**Return:**
```json
{
  "threshold_met": true/false,
  "decisions_by_directory": {
    "src/auth": 4,
    "src/api": 2
  },
  "learnings_by_directory": {
    "src/auth": 3,
    "src/api": 1
  },
  "session_pattern": "first_session" | "returning" | "multi_session",
  "capture_ready": ["src/auth"],
  "consider_updating": [],
  "security_insights": [],
  "reasoning": "Why or why not threshold met",
  "recommendation": "Proceed with save → possible CLAUDE.md update for src/auth" | "Save learnings but no CLAUDE.md yet"
}
```

## Examples

### Learning Assessment Example

**Input:**
```
Learning: "express-rate-limit auto-adds X-RateLimit-* headers - don't manually set them"
Context: src/api middleware
Type: learning
```

**Output:**
```json
{
  "quality_score": 5,
  "six_month_test": "pass",
  "criteria": {
    "non_obvious": true,
    "prevents_mistakes": true,
    "durable": true,
    "specific": true,
    "actionable": true
  },
  "recommendation": "capture",
  "reasoning": "Non-obvious gotcha specific to express-rate-limit that prevents duplicate header errors. Still relevant in 6 months."
}
```

### Low-Quality Learning Example

**Input:**
```
Learning: "Used express-rate-limit for rate limiting"
Context: src/api
Type: learning
```

**Output:**
```json
{
  "quality_score": 1,
  "six_month_test": "fail",
  "criteria": {
    "non_obvious": false,
    "prevents_mistakes": false,
    "durable": false,
    "specific": false,
    "actionable": false
  },
  "recommendation": "skip",
  "reasoning": "Observable from code and package.json. No new insight here. Generic library usage."
}
```

## Integration with Other Gatekeepers

- **save.md** calls this gatekeeper to filter learnings before proposing CLAUDE.md updates
- **grow.md** calls this gatekeeper to assess documentation value before creating/updating CLAUDE.md
- **claudemd-gatekeeper** relies on assessments from this gatekeeper for quality-aware proposals
