# CLAUDE.md Proposal Gatekeeper

Handles all CLAUDE.md creation and update proposals with integrated size validation, quality filtering, and user approval workflows.

## Operations

### Generate Proposal

**Input:**
- Target directory (e.g., "src/auth", "." for root)
- Proposed content (learnings, decisions, or analysis results)
- Operation type: "create" or "update"
- Context (why this is valuable)

**Process:**

1. **Determine context:**
   - Is this root (max 200 lines) or module (max 150 lines)?
   - Does CLAUDE.md exist? If yes, read current content and count lines

2. **Apply quality filter:**
   - Ask quality-gatekeeper to assess proposed content
   - Filter to high-quality content only
   - Note what was filtered out

3. **Calculate size budget:**
   - If creating: start at 0, propose up to target (120-150 for root, 80-100 for module)
   - If updating:
     - Calculate remaining space
     - If >80% capacity: identify stale content to prune first
     - Plan removals BEFORE additions
     - Target net-zero or negative growth

4. **Generate diff/proposal:**
   - Show what's being added
   - Show what's being removed (if updating and >80%)
   - Include size: current → proposed (X/Y lines)

**Return:**
```json
{
  "directory": "src/auth",
  "is_root": false,
  "max_lines": 150,
  "operation": "update",
  "current_lines": 98,
  "capacity_percent": 65,
  "quality_filtered": {
    "proposed": 8,
    "passing_filter": 6,
    "rejected": 2,
    "rejection_reasons": ["Not specific to codebase", "Too obvious"]
  },
  "proposed_additions": [
    "- Feature flags stored in Redis, not config files",
    "- Health checks must exclude rate limiting middleware"
  ],
  "proposed_removals": [],
  "final_size": 104,
  "size_change": "+6 lines",
  "status": "ready_for_approval",
  "sizing_notes": "Plenty of room (65% capacity, 46 lines available)"
}
```

### Generate Proposal (Pruning Required)

**When updating and >80% capacity:**

**Return:**
```json
{
  "directory": "src/api",
  "operation": "update",
  "current_lines": 142,
  "capacity_percent": 95,
  "status": "needs_pruning",
  "proposed_additions": [...],
  "suggested_removals": [
    {
      "text": "Old Express 3.x compatibility note",
      "reason": "Outdated - we're on Express 5.x now"
    },
    {
      "text": "Legacy authentication flow details",
      "reason": "No longer used, new OAuth pattern is primary"
    }
  ],
  "sizing_notes": "At 95% capacity. Must remove content before adding. Suggested removals would free 8 lines, making room for new content."
}
```

### Present for Approval

**Input:**
- Proposal (from Generate Proposal)

**Process:**

Display the proposal with clear size information and wait for user response.

**For new files:**
```
📝 Proposed CLAUDE.md for src/auth

Proposed content (12 lines, target: 80-100 lines):
─────────────────────────────────
Key decisions:
- Feature flags stored in Redis, not config files
- Health checks must exclude rate limiting middleware
- OAuth tokens refresh 1 hour before expiry
...
─────────────────────────────────

Create src/auth/CLAUDE.md?
[yes / edit / later / no]
```

**For updates with room:**
```
💡 Update src/auth/CLAUDE.md?

Current size: 98 / 150 lines (65%)
Proposed addition: +6 lines → 104 lines final (69%)
Plenty of room for more insights.

Additions:
─────────────────────────────────
- Feature flags stored in Redis, not config files
- Health checks must exclude rate limiting middleware
─────────────────────────────────

Add this to src/auth/CLAUDE.md?
[yes / edit / later / no]
```

**For updates needing pruning:**
```
💡 Update src/api/CLAUDE.md?

Current size: 142 / 150 lines (95%) - APPROACHING LIMIT

To maintain conciseness, here are both additions and removals:

Remove (8 lines):
─────────────────────────────────
- Old Express 3.x compatibility note
- Legacy authentication flow details
─────────────────────────────────

Add (6 lines):
─────────────────────────────────
- Connection pooling prevents cascading failures
- Rate limiting must apply per-user, not globally
─────────────────────────────────

Net change: -2 lines → 140 lines final (93%)

Apply these changes to src/api/CLAUDE.md?
[yes / edit / later / no]
```

**Handle user response:**
- **yes:** Proceed to Apply Proposal
- **edit:** Enter edit mode, allow refinement, regenerate with new content
- **later:** Save to work file with timestamp, don't apply
- **no:** Cancel, don't apply

**Return:**
```json
{
  "user_response": "yes" | "edit" | "later" | "no",
  "action": "proceed" | "editing" | "saved" | "cancelled"
}
```

### Apply Proposal

**Input:**
- Approved proposal

**Process:**

1. **Final size validation:**
   - Count lines in final content
   - Verify ≤200 (root) or ≤150 (module)
   - If over: ask user to trim further, don't apply

2. **Create or update file:**
   - Use Edit tool for updates
   - Use Write tool for new files
   - Atomic write (all or nothing)

3. **Verify written correctly:**
   - Read file back
   - Count lines in written file
   - Confirm within limits

**Return:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "path": "src/auth/CLAUDE.md",
  "operation": "created" | "updated",
  "final_lines": 104,
  "max_lines": 150,
  "capacity_percent": 69,
  "message": "✅ Created src/auth/CLAUDE.md (104 / 150 lines, 69%)"
}
```

### Check if Update Needed

**Input:**
- Directory path
- Analysis data or learnings from session
- Current CLAUDE.md status (if exists)

**Process:**

1. **Determine if patterns have emerged:**
   - 3+ decisions in directory?
   - 2+ sessions in same directory?
   - Recurring patterns?
   - Security/performance insights?

2. **Apply quality filter:**
   - Ask quality-gatekeeper if content would pass 6-month test
   - Check if patterns are actionable
   - Verify it's specific to codebase

3. **Assess timing:**
   - First session? Probably too early
   - Multiple decisions emerging? Good time to document
   - Too early or not enough clarity? Suggest waiting

**Return:**
```json
{
  "directory": "src/auth",
  "recommendation": "create" | "update" | "wait",
  "reasoning": "3+ decisions in this directory suggest patterns. Quality filter passed. Ready to document.",
  "factors": {
    "decision_count": 4,
    "session_count": 1,
    "pattern_clarity": "high",
    "quality_score": 4.2,
    "six_month_relevance": true
  },
  "suggested_timing": "now" | "after_more_work"
}
```

## Integration Points

### With Quality Gatekeeper

- Calls quality-gatekeeper to filter proposed content
- Uses quality scores to decide what to include
- Follows quality assessment criteria

### With State Gatekeeper

- Reads work files (provided by state-gatekeeper) to find learnings
- Checks directory context from state

### With Save Workflow

When save.md captures learnings:
1. Pass learnings to quality-gatekeeper
2. If threshold met: ask claudemd-gatekeeper to generate proposal
3. User approves/edits proposal
4. Apply changes

### With Grow Workflow

When grow.md analyzes directory:
1. Ask claudemd-gatekeeper to check if update needed
2. Ask quality-gatekeeper to assess documentation value
3. If yes: generate proposal
4. User approves/edits proposal
5. Apply changes
