# Keep Start - Begin Work on Issue

Start work on a GitHub issue by loading context, creating work tracking files, and presenting an informed starting point.

## Core Workflow

### 1. Determine Issue Number and Check for Resume

**If issue number provided:**
- First check for existing work file (resume detection)
- Then proceed based on resume status

**If no issue number (Zero-Issues Workflow):**
1. Check if CLAUDE.md exists and is current
   - If missing: Offer `/keep:grow .` first
2. Discover starter work using native tools:
   - **Planning docs** (Glob): `{ROADMAP,TODO,PLAN,BACKLOG,VISION}*.md`
   - **Code signals** (Grep): `TODO:|FIXME:|HACK:|BUG:` with `-n -B 1 -A 1`
   - **Test gaps** (Glob): Compare test files vs source files
3. Synthesize 3-5 issue suggestions prioritized by:
   - Planning docs > FIXME/BUG > TODO > missing tests
   - Include source attribution (file:line)
4. User selects which issues to create
5. Ensure labels exist, create via `gh issue create`
6. User picks issue to start

See `skills/keep/references/zero-issues.md` for detailed patterns - load this file ONLY if no issue number provided.

### 1a. Resume Detection (When Issue Number Provided)

Before fetching from GitHub, check if this is resuming existing work:

**Check for existing work file:**
```bash
test -f .claude/work/{issue-number}.md && echo "EXISTS" || echo "NEW"
```

**If work file EXISTS (resume scenario):**

1. **Read work file metadata:**
   - Check "Last Updated" timestamp from Progress Log section
   - Read current progress, decisions, and next steps
   - Extract issue title and description from work file

2. **Read state.md to confirm active status:**
   ```bash
   grep "Current Issue: #{issue-number}" .claude/state.md
   ```

3. **Calculate freshness:**
   - Parse last "Progress Log" timestamp
   - Calculate hours since last update
   - Categorize: Recent (< 24h), Moderate (24-48h), Stale (> 48h)

4. **Resume strategy by freshness:**

   **Recent (< 24 hours) - Auto Resume:**
   - Skip GitHub API call (use cached data from work file)
   - Present resume summary immediately
   - Load context (CLAUDE.md files)
   - Show progress, decisions, and next steps from work file

   **Moderate (24-48 hours) - Confirm First:**
   - Present work file data briefly
   - Ask: "This was last updated {time-ago}. Resume with cached data, or refetch from GitHub for latest status?"
   - If resume: Use cached data, skip GitHub
   - If refetch: Proceed to GitHub fetch (normal workflow)

   **Stale (> 48 hours) OR not in state.md - Refetch:**
   - Note: "Resuming work from {time-ago}"
   - Fetch fresh data from GitHub (proceed to step 2)
   - Update work file with any new information from GitHub
   - Present as "refreshed resume"

5. **Resume presentation format:**
   ```markdown
   ‚úÖ Resuming work on issue #{number}

   üìã Issue: {title}
   ‚è±Ô∏è  Last updated: {time-ago} ({human-readable timestamp})

   üìù Where you left off:
   - {most recent progress entry}
   - {key accomplishment}
   - {current status}

   üí° Decisions captured:
   - {decision 1}
   - {decision 2}

   üìÇ Context loaded:
   ‚îú‚îÄ CLAUDE.md (project overview)
   ‚îî‚îÄ {module}/CLAUDE.md (if relevant)

   üéØ Next steps (from last session):
   1. {next action 1}
   2. {next action 2}
   3. {next action 3}

   ‚ùì Open questions:
   - {question 1}
   - {question 2}

   Ready to continue?
   ```

**If work file DOES NOT EXIST (new work):**
- Proceed to step 2 (Fetch Issue from GitHub)
- This is a fresh start on this issue

**Performance benefits of resume:**
- Avoids GitHub API call (faster, preserves rate limits)
- Instant context loading from cached work file
- User sees their exact progress, not just issue description
- No network dependency for recent work

**Validation of cached data:**
- Work file must have valid timestamp format
- Work file must contain issue number matching requested
- If work file corrupted: warn user, offer to fetch fresh from GitHub

### 2. Fetch Issue from GitHub

```bash
gh issue view {number} --json title,body,labels,state
```

Parse issue body for:
- Requirements and acceptance criteria
- Dependencies ("depends on #123")
- Related issues
- Technical constraints

**If GitHub unavailable:**
- Warn user about offline mode
- Offer to continue locally
- Skip GitHub sync
- Never fail workflow

### 3. Load Context

Load in this order:
1. **Root CLAUDE.md** - Auto-loaded by Claude Code
2. **Module CLAUDE.md** - Auto-loaded by Claude Code for relevant directories
3. **`.claude/state.md`** - Read manually to understand current session state
4. **`.claude/archive/`** - Search for related past work (same labels, similar area)

Use Grep to find related archived issues: `grep -l "label-name" .claude/archive/*.md`

### 4. Suggest Approach

Based on loaded context, suggest concrete approach:
- Reference similar patterns from CLAUDE.md
- Note related work from archive
- Identify technical approaches that fit project conventions
- Raise questions if requirements unclear

Be conversational, not prescriptive. Help user think through approach.

### 5. Create Work File

Create `.claude/work/{issue-number}.md` using format from `skills/keep/references/file-formats.md` (load if needed for format details).

**Key sections:**
- Issue metadata (GitHub URL, status, timestamps)
- Issue description
- Planned approach
- Empty sections: Progress Log, Decisions Made, Files Modified, Learnings, Tests, Next Actions

Use ISO 8601 timestamps: `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`

### 6. Update State

Update or create `.claude/state.md`:
- Set active issue: `#{number} - {title}`
- Record start time
- Clear previous active work (move to Recent Work)
- Note branch if known

See `skills/keep/references/file-formats.md` for state.md format.

### 7. Present Starting Point

Provide conversational summary with:
- Issue summary and labels
- Context loaded (which CLAUDE.md files)
- Related past work
- Suggested approach
- Questions needing clarification
- Offer to begin implementation

## Error Handling

See `agents/shared/error-handling.md` for error patterns and recovery strategies.

## Directory Structure

Ensure these exist (create if missing):
```bash
mkdir -p .claude/work
mkdir -p .claude/archive
```

Create `.claude/state.md` if missing.

## Best Practices & Philosophy

See `agents/shared/principles.md` for core execution principles including conversational approach, graceful failure, and progressive disclosure.

## Workflow Hint

After successfully starting work, provide this next step hint to help users learn the cadence:

```
üí° **Next steps:** As you work, use `/keep:save` to checkpoint progress and capture decisions. Run it at natural breakpoints (after implementing features, making key decisions, or every 30-45 min).
```
