# Keep Start - Begin Work on Issue

Start work on a GitHub issue by loading context, creating work tracking files, and presenting an informed starting point.

## Core Workflow

### 1. Determine Issue Number

**If issue number provided:**
- Proceed to fetch issue from GitHub

**If no issue number (Zero-Issues Workflow):**
1. Check if CLAUDE.md exists and is current
   - If missing: Offer `/keep:grow .` first
2. Discover starter work using native tools:
   - **Planning docs** (Glob): `{ROADMAP,TODO,PLAN,BACKLOG,VISION}*.md`
   - **Code signals** (Grep): `TODO:|FIXME:|HACK:|BUG:` with `-n -B 1 -A 1`
   - **Test gaps** (Glob): Compare test files vs source files
3. Synthesize 3-5 issue suggestions prioritized by:
   - Planning docs > FIXME/BUG > TODO > missing tests
   - Include source attribution (file:line)
4. User selects which issues to create
5. Ensure labels exist, create via `gh issue create`
6. User picks issue to start

See `skills/keep/references/zero-issues.md` for detailed patterns - load this file ONLY if no issue number provided.

### 2. Fetch Issue from GitHub

```bash
gh issue view {number} --json title,body,labels,state
```

Parse issue body for:
- Requirements and acceptance criteria
- Dependencies ("depends on #123")
- Related issues
- Technical constraints

**If GitHub unavailable:**
- Warn user about offline mode
- Offer to continue locally
- Skip GitHub sync
- Never fail workflow

### 3. Load Context

Load in this order:
1. **Root CLAUDE.md** - Auto-loaded by Claude Code
2. **Module CLAUDE.md** - Auto-loaded by Claude Code for relevant directories
3. **`.claude/state.md`** - Read manually to understand current session state
4. **`.claude/archive/`** - Search for related past work (same labels, similar area)

Use Grep to find related archived issues: `grep -l "label-name" .claude/archive/*.md`

### 4. Suggest Approach

Based on loaded context, suggest concrete approach:
- Reference similar patterns from CLAUDE.md
- Note related work from archive
- Identify technical approaches that fit project conventions
- Raise questions if requirements unclear

Be conversational, not prescriptive. Help user think through approach.

### 5. Create Work File

Create `.claude/work/{issue-number}.md` using format from `skills/keep/references/file-formats.md` (load if needed for format details).

**Key sections:**
- Issue metadata (GitHub URL, status, timestamps)
- Issue description
- Planned approach
- Empty sections: Progress Log, Decisions Made, Files Modified, Learnings, Tests, Next Actions

Use ISO 8601 timestamps: `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`

### 6. Update State

Update or create `.claude/state.md`:
- Set active issue: `#{number} - {title}`
- Record start time
- Clear previous active work (move to Recent Work)
- Note branch if known

See `skills/keep/references/file-formats.md` for state.md format.

### 7. Present Starting Point

Provide conversational summary with:
- Issue summary and labels
- Context loaded (which CLAUDE.md files)
- Related past work
- Suggested approach
- Questions needing clarification
- Offer to begin implementation

## Error Handling

**GitHub unavailable:**
- Check `which gh` first
- If missing or network error: Warn and offer local-only mode
- Continue workflow without GitHub
- Note sync needed for later

**Issue not found:**
- Verify issue number
- Suggest checking GitHub web UI
- Offer to create new issue or work without tracking

**Corrupted state:**
- If `.claude/state.md` invalid: Reconstruct from work files
- Show reconstructed state for confirmation
- Never silently delete - backup to `.claude/state.md.backup`

See `skills/keep/references/troubleshooting.md` for detailed error handling - load only when encountering errors.

## Directory Structure

Ensure these exist (create if missing):
```bash
mkdir -p .claude/work
mkdir -p .claude/archive
```

Create `.claude/state.md` if missing.

## Best Practices

**Be conversational:**
- Present findings naturally, not as form fields
- Ask questions when requirements unclear
- Suggest, don't prescribe

**Fail gracefully:**
- Work offline if GitHub unavailable
- Continue with partial context if files missing
- Preserve user data above all else

**Progressive disclosure:**
- Don't overwhelm with all details at once
- Load references only when needed
- Present information as user needs it

## Philosophy

Keep starting work should feel like having an informed teammate who:
- Understands the project context
- Remembers related work
- Suggests practical approaches
- Asks good questions
- Gets you started quickly

Focus on being helpful, not ceremonial.
